The goal of the game is to get as many points as possible by collecting stars before the time runs out!

Every time you collect a star bonus time is added to the clock.

To collect the stars you have to draw rainbow trampolines to make the characters bounce around without falling down.

The smaller the trampoline, the higher the bounce!

The trampolines you draw don't stay forever so be ready to draw another!

The game gives you a premade big trampoline that doesn't run out until someone bounces on it.

The difficulty changes the number of characters you can have at the same time and the game speed.
